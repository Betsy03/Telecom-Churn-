**Project Overview**
Telecom Churn Prediction involves predicting whether a customer is likely to leave the telecom service provider based on historical data and features related to customer behavior, usage patterns, and service engagement. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop an accurate predictive model.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project can be found in data/ directory. It includes historical customer data with various features such as usage, contract details, and customer demographics. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

**Model Architecture**
The predictive model uses a machine learning approach, employing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, ADA Boost and XG Boost, or any other relevant algorithm. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset.
